  <div class="col-lg-7">
    <p class="abstract">The latest marketing fad and hype in our industry is the pushing of machine learning as a magic panacea for all cyber ills. We're told that by utilizing artistically crafted pixie dust and rainbow unicorn algorithms all your cyber woes can cured. Unfortunately, otherwise rational people in our industry seem to give a lot of weight to these marketing claims because 1) machine learning is complicated and 2) we've seen machine learning do some really incredible things like drive cars, beat the best Go players, "dream" crazy images, etc. This talk will illustrate some of the hype we're being bombarded with, pull back the covers on what machine learning is and how it works, present some basic statistics (Bayesian) and show why security is a much harder problem for machine learning than we realize. </p>

    <p class="bio">Like all great cyber security thought leaders, Brandon Enright is a self-aggrandizing media <span style="background-color: black; font-weight: bold; color: white">REDACTED</span>. When he isn't leading cyber infosec thoughts, he's leading cyber dreams. Brandon can factor large primes with nothing more than pencil and paper and even recite the digits of Pi in random order in arbitrary bases. Recognized as one of the great legends in machine learning, several of Brandon's machines have learned so much Harvard is working on granting them PhDs. Rumor has it that shortly after Elon Musk met Brandon, Elon bought a small island in the south pacific for shelter and revised his estimate of the coming singularity up a decade. Brandon is why Bruce Schneier has trouble sleeping at night.</p>

    <p class="abstract">Commercial radio communications have evolved from islands of single-media, low-datarate "dumb" analog repeaters to interconnections of multiplexed, high-speed, self-optimizing multimedia networks. Due to budgetary and legacy reasons, many amateur radio systems have not changed notably in the last decades. Unwilling to let this great hobby (and emergency resource) atrophy, the dedicated VA4WAN group is installing a High-Speed MultiMedia "HAMWAN" around and beyond Winnipeg, repurposing donated 2.4/5.8ghz outdoor Wi-Fi gear into the 2.3/5.9Ghz amateur radio frequency bands. This presentation introduces the amateur radio hobby, the VA4WAN project's goals, methods, current status and future plans.</p>

But the reality is, there are lots of us, just like hi,, who want to know more but are either overwhelmed by the idea that buffer overflows are beyond their capabilities or just don’t know where to get started. This is a 101-level talk; it’ll talk about how a buffer overflow works, how to fuzz an app to identify an overflow opportunity, and how to create a simple overflow that will result in a compromise of a target system. If you can already smash the stack, spray the heap, and write ROP chains in your sleep, this isn’t the talk for you.

When you leave, you will have the information necessary to help you write your first overflow when you walk out the door. </p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-7">
    <p class="abstract">Let's talk about risk assessment and personal security! As technically inclined people, we are at an advantage when it comes to our privacy and security. We are more aware of the risks and consequences associated with our use of technology than the average person. For them, standard security advice is overwhelming, unrealistic and failure to comply comes with intangible consequences. Sensationalist media coverage of obscure DDoS attacks from China combined with the reality that people tend to suck at assessing risk means that the average person is more worried about the Russian government reading their email than they are of giving their own password away. On the other side of things, as professionals who have some idea of what actually can go wrong, our trouble with assessing risk tends to take us in the opposite direction. We lock everything down to the point of missing out on some of the cool things that our tech can offer us. This talk looks at how we can help ourselves and the people around us better assess their risk so we can start giving more realistic advice.</p>

    <p class="bio">Sarah started her education in technology by hanging out with IT professionals and hobbyists who were passionate about their projects. She grew that interest by volunteering at conferences and asking lots of questions. When she finally had more questions than her friends could answer, she decided it was time for a more formal education. She started with Applied Computer Science and Business Administration at University of Winnipeg, then studied Digital Forensics, Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking at Glasgow Caledonian University in Scotland before transferring into the Business Information Technology program at Red River College. She is currently on the board of technology student group, Bits and Bytes Association. Never quite satisfied with her current level of knowledge, Sarah is always working to strengthen her skills and build her expertise by taking on side projects and talking to people more experienced than herself. Upon graduation (expected: June, 2019), she wants to work as a security analyst. She enjoys hipster coffee, going to the gym, and Instagramming her food.
